It explores the role of human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, in releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The consequences of global warming include rising sea levels, extreme weather events, loss of biodiversity, and disruptions to ecosystems and human societies. Various mitigation and adaptation strategies are being implemented to combat global warming, including transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

This essay explores the importance of school days in shaping our lives, discussing key arguments, supporting evidence, counterarguments, and concluding with the significance of this topic.\n","\n","Background Information:\n","School days are a crucial period in every individual's life, typically spanning from early childhood to adolescence. During this time, we acquire knowledge, develop social skills, and lay the groundwork for our future endeavors. The experiences and lessons learned during our school days have a lasting impact on our personal growth and overall well-being.\n","\n","Key Arguments:\n","1. Academic Development: School days provide a structured environment for academic learning, enabling students to acquire essential knowledge and skills. The curriculum, teachers, and educational resources contribute to intellectual growth, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and a thirst for knowledge.\n","\n","2. Social and Emotional Development: School days offer numerous opportunities for social interaction, allowing students to develop interpersonal skills, empathy, and teamwork. Through friendships, extracurricular activities, and group projects, students learn to navigate social dynamics, build relationships, and develop emotional intelligence.\n","\n","3. Character Building: School days play a pivotal role in shaping an individual's character. The values instilled by teachers and the school community, such as honesty, respect, and responsibility, contribute to the development of moral and ethical principles. Additionally, facing challenges, overcoming obstacles, and learning from failures during school days build resilience and perseverance.\n","\n","Supporting Evidence:\n","- Research studies consistently show that individuals who have completed their education tend to have higher earning potential and better career prospects.\n","- Longitudinal studies have demonstrated that positive social interactions during school days contribute to improved mental health and overall well-being.\n","- Numerous successful individuals attribute their achievements to the values and skills they acquired during their school days.\n","\n","Counterarguments:\n","Some may argue that school days can be restrictive and fail to cater to individual needs and interests. Additionally, the pressure to conform to societal expectations and academic demands can lead to stress and burnout. However, it is important to note that schools are evolving to address these concerns, with increased focus on personalized learning, mental health support, and holistic development.\n","\n","Conclusion:\n","School days are a transformative period in our lives\"\"\"\n","\n","\n","prompt_tp = PromptTemplate(template=prompt,input_variables=['topic'])\n","bleu_scores = model_api_call(topic,prompt_tp,actual_text)\n","bleu_scores"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"4bb3f7c1","metadata":{"id":"4bb3f7c1","outputId":"4f1f3c6c-f6b4-4fa7-917f-0403cf365858"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["the model is-----\n"," google/flan-t5-base\n","the output text is----------\n"," No\n","the model is-----\n"," google/flan-t5-xxl\n","the output text is----------\n"," Yes\n","the model is-----\n"," google/flan-t5-large\n","the output text is----------\n"," Yes\n","the model is-----\n"," tiiuae/falcon-7b\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["C:\\Users\\Lenovo\\.conda\\envs\\langchainv2\\Lib\\site-packages\\nltk\\translate\\bleu_score.py:552: UserWarning: \n","The hypothesis contains 0 counts of 2-gram overlaps.\n","Therefore the BLEU score evaluates to 0, independently of\n","how many N-gram overlaps of lower order it contains.\n","Consider using lower n-gram order or use SmoothingFunction()\n","  warnings.warn(_msg)\n","C:\\Users\\Lenovo\\.conda\\envs\\langchainv2\\Lib\\site-packages\\nltk\\translate\\bleu_score.py:552: UserWarning: \n","The hypothesis contains 0 counts of 3-gram overlaps.\n","Therefore the BLEU score evaluates to 0, independently of\n","how many N-gram overlaps of lower order it contains.\n","Consider using lower n-gram order or use SmoothingFunction()\n","  warnings.warn(_msg)\n","C:\\Users\\Lenovo\\.conda\\envs\\langchainv2\\Lib\\site-packages\\nltk\\translate\\bleu_score.py:552: UserWarning: \n","The hypothesis contains 0 counts of 4-gram overlaps.\n","Therefore the BLEU score evaluates to 0, independently of\n","how many N-gram overlaps of lower order it contains.\n","Consider using lower n-gram order or use SmoothingFunction()\n","  warnings.warn(_msg)\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["the output text is----------\n"," \n","- print Print\n","- list Cite\n","1 Answer\n","Changing the altitude of a body of\n","the model is-----\n"," tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct\n","the output text is----------\n"," \n","Yes\n"]},{"data":{"text/plain":["([0, 0, 0, 1.2183324802375697e-231, 0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.025, 0.0])"]},"execution_count":47,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["text = \"\"\"does changing the altitude cause a change in temperature?
